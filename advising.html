            <p>My email: yg [at] robots.ox.ac.uk</p>
            <p>I'm honoured that you're considering me as an advisorðŸ™‚ feel free to reach out and we'll either find a project for you to work on or see that you want something I can't offer, in which case I'll try and direct you to a helping hand. By default reach out, but I recommend first thinking deeply about what you want - I want to cherish my students but I can only help them help themselves.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I tend to see different types of students, which broadly fall into two categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Students who have their own dreams and can answer "what are you interested in?". Good answers are typically deep, unrelated to passing trends. The answer doesn't need to be specific, I have a lot of respect for whoever can say "I'm curious about ABC because of XYZ but don't yet know enough to have a deep opinion on it".</li>
                <li>Students who are still developing their taste. This can, maybe surprisingly, especially happen with highly ambitious students from competitive institutions. It's hard to think "huh, what do I want?" after being used to solving problems more than asking questions. Being a creative independent researcher isn't for everyone, and that's fine.</li>

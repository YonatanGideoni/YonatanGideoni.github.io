            <p>My email: yg [at] robots.ox.ac.uk</p>
            <p>I'm honoured that you're considering me as an advisorðŸ™‚ feel free to reach out and we'll either find a project for you to work on or see that you want something I can't offer, in which case I'll try and direct you to a helping hand. By default reach out, but I recommend first thinking deeply about what you want - I want to cherish my students but I can only help them help themselves.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I tend to see different types of students, which broadly fall into two categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Students who have their own dreams and can answer "what are you interested in?". Here I mean deeply answer, not just generically whatever's hot right now. There may be good reasons to work on something hypey, but glamour shouldn't be it! The answer doesn't need to be specific, I have a lot of respect for whoever can say "I'm curious about ABC because of XYZ but don't yet know enough to have a deep opinion on it".</li>
                <li>Students who are still developing their taste. This can, maybe surprisingly, especially happen with highly ambitious students from competitive institutions. It's hard to think "huh, what do I find want?" after being taught to solve problems without asking many questions. In these cases it's especially important to know what you want, because being a creative independent researcher isn't everyone's answer - that's fine, but let's be upfront about it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Just to be clear, a good student doesn't need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insane grades</li>
                <li>To have started coding when they were 5</li>
                <li>To be at a certain stage in life<span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span class="footnote-text">I've advised wonderful high school students' projects before. Middle school would be tough, maybe one day.</span></span></li>
                <li>Be in the same institution or even country^2{The modern web is wonderful in not only breaking down barriers but allowing educational mobility like never before.}</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wonderful nonorthodox things can happen for students that know what they want. If your idea of a successful project is one that ends with a publication, dream biggerðŸ™‚</p>
